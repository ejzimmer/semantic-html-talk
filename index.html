							HTML elements have intrinsic meaning, separate from their appearance,
							and this meaning is important.

							Using correct, semantic HTML provides the browser - or other rendering device 
							- with important clues about how to deal with your content.

					<div class="notes">
						<p>
							The most frequenty cited use case for this is screen readers (and similar assistive 
							technologies). Screen readers use the structure of your document to help the user navigate
							the page. For example, a screen reader will generate a list of headings and a list of links 
							on the page and read these out to the user. If you're not using headings correctly (or you're 
							using buttons instead of links), then the user isn't going to get a good feel for what's going 
							on in your app.
						</p>
						<p>
							Screen readers also allow a user to navigate via regions on a page. Regions are things like 
							<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> blocks.

					<div>Should we care?</div>
					<div class="notes">
						<p>
							The thing is though, screen readers account for a very small percentage of users. So is it
							really worth the effort?
						</p>
						<p>
							Yes, it is. For a couple of reasons.

							Firstly, we are legally obligated to make our site accessible to all our users.

							Secondly, if we can justify all the time, frustration, and effort required to get our sites 
							working in IE, then we can definitely justify making our sites accessible. Getting a page to
							work correctly in IE usually involves making it <i>worse</i> for other users. We add JavaScript 
							polyfills other browsers don't need, and nasty CSS hacks. Making a page accessible makes it 
							<i>better</i> - for other users, but also for developers working on it later.

							And, on that note - making our page more accessible, through techniques like using semantic 
							HTML, isn't just about making it better for screen readers. It's about helping all our users.
							Microsoft has this great chart, showing how accessibilty is important for everyone - not just 
							the people we traditionally think of as disabled.

							It's also important to remember that not everyone is accessing your site through a nice 
							laptop, or a high end phone. Making your site accessible - especially through the use of 
							semantic HTML - is going to help users on all these types of devices. Many of these devices 
							will not load your CSS, or may not run your JavaScript, meaning your HTML is all you have 
							to stand on.

						<p>
							And even if you decide that you don't have to worry about any of that - it's still better to use 
							semantic HTML, because browsers add behaviour to elements based on their semantics.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, on this page, we have a link, and a button with an onclick handler that navigates to 
							a page. The two things aren't equivalent though. If you hover or focus on the link, you'll get a little
							pop-up telling you where the link goes. And you can shift+click on the link to open it in a new window.
						</p>
						<p>
							The button, on the other hand, will always open in the same tab. Furthermore, a button can be clicked
							using either the enter key or space bar, while a link will only work with the enter key. (If you hit
							space on the button here, it'll go to the next slide, then navigate to the next page, because slide 
							software).

						<p>
							In an ideal world, we'd be building our apps according to this pyramid. A solid base of HTML,
							with all the core information and functionality of the site. On top of this, CSS to give your 
							page personality and style, and to enhance usability, where relevant. This is the point where
							you apply all the stuff from the mock-ups that the designers give you - in the CSS <i>not</i>
							the HTML.

					<h2>Normal h2 heading</h2>
					<h2 style="text-transform: none; font-size: 1.2em; text-decoration: underline">Smaller h2 heading</h2>
					<pre style="margin-top: 50px"><code style="font-size: 42px;">
  <h2 class="small">Small heading</h2>
					</code></pre>
					<div class="notes">
						<p>
							For example, if your app has H2 level headings that look like the normal H2 heading here. Then, on one 
							page, inexplicably, the heading is smaller, like the second heading, but it's still the second-level 
							heading on the page. Chances are, the designer has labelled this as a h3. They are incorrect. Ignore
							them.
						</p>
						<p>
							Instead, you should implement it as per the code snippet. It's a h2 element, with a class that changes
							its appearance. Same thing if you have links that look like buttons (or vice versa). Semantically,
							they're links. Use an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, and change its appearance using CSS.

							Because changing your HTML to accommodate the appearance of the page is how you get table layouts, like
							this one. And nobody wants that, right? (I recommend clicking the Junior Jam link, if you really

							If we continue up this pyramid, you can see that ARIA and JavaScript should play a relatively small 
							role. The ARIA bit probably makes sense by now - if you're using semantic HTML, then you shouldn't 
							need to add aria-roles to most elements. You'll still need some for edge-case stuff, but probably 
							95% of your HTML won't need it.
						</p>
						<p>
							But what about JavaScript? According to our pyramid, it should be used sparingly, for enhancements only,
							not for core functionality. Why is that?

							The answer is that JavaScript is expensive. JavaScript bundles are big - they take a lot of time and 
							bandwidth to download. They also take a lot of processing power to render. When Chrome uses up all the 
							RAM on your computer, it's not because of all the HTML it's processing.
						</p>
						<p>
							This graph is me looking at Twitter for 10 seconds. I was using a late-model MacBook Pro, so the processor 
							had no trouble - as evidenced by all the idle time. But of the time it was working, The vast majority of 
							its efforts went into handling JavaScript.

						<p>
							Unfortunately, the world of Single Page Apps (or SPAs) makes it very difficult to follow this principle.
							In my opinion, SPAs make for a really great developer experience, but they probably aren't the best 
							experience for users. At least not in all the cases where we use them. There are technologies available 
							to improve the situation a bit - like server-side rendering - but it's probably time that we started 
							questioning whether a SPA is always automatically the best option.

						<p>
							In the meantime though, we can do our best to improve our user experiences by creating solid, 
							semantic HTML bases for our components, using CSS to control the styling, and using JavaScript 
							only where we have to.
